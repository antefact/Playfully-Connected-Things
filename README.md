# Playfully Connected Things

## New York August 28 â€“ September 1, 2017

Most of the discussion around connected products is focusing nowadays on creating new and more efficient futures, to quantify and explain the world around us. But what if we could transform these products into something that allows you to explore and play instead? What if instead of a graph with numbers on a screen we could turn data into stories to follow and game to solve? What if instead of hidden and untouchable sensors we could turn them into playful and tangible things?

We will not talk about gamification, but we will actually focus on redefining what play means in the era of connectivity and sensing. Starting from hacking existing games, we will learn how to create new tangible controls using sensors and how to use data that we can gather from the environment around us and online. Ultimately we will imagine and prototype new play experiences that move away from the screen only and use connectivity to merge digital and physical worlds.
