# Microbit ble test
This example shows you how to interact with all the services offered by the micro:bit.

don't bother writing a firmware use the default one you can download [here](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/resources/BBC_MICROBIT_OOB_FINAL.zip).

*that one works smoothly but requires pairing, with this hex you don't need pairing
[Main Bluetooth services, pairing not required](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B2Ud_NaMFsQSdm1BMVMtN3F4a3c&export=download) and it works smoothly with the example. Found on http://www.bittysoftware.com/downloads.html. (need to better understand how to reproduce this)


for more info about micro:bit ble services please refer to the [official documentation](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/ble/profile/).
